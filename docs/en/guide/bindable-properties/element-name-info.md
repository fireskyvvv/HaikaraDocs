# ElementNameInfo

A struct used to specify which `Visual Element` to construct the binding for.  
When binding is executed, this struct’s data is used to search for the `Visual Element` within the .uxml associated with the View class.
Implicit conversion from `string` is possible. In this case, `ElementFindType` becomes `First`.

## elementName

Specifies the name of the `Visual Element` to be bound.
A list of names of `Visual Elements` on the .uxml corresponding to the View class is generated by the SourceGenerator as [`Element Names`](../source-generation/view-source-generation.md#elementnames).

## index

Used only when `ElementFindType` is `Index`.  
If multiple `Visual Elements` with the same name are found, only the one at the specified index will be bound.

## ElementFindType

An enum that determines how to search for `Visual Element`.

### ElementFindType.First

Binds to the `Visual Element` obtained by `VisualElement.Query<T>().First`.  
When type-converted from `string`, this is also set to `First`.

### ElementFindType.Index

If there are multiple `Visual Elements` with the same name, binding is performed on the one at the index specified by `index`.

### ElementFindType.All

If there are multiple `Visual Elements` with the same name, binding is performed on all of them.
